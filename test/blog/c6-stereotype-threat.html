		<h1>We Deserve to Be Here</h1>
		<h2>The "Imposter Phenomenon"</h2>
		<h4>7|21|15</h4>
	
	<section>
		<p>Part of the DBC curriculum for the second week of Phase 0 involved connecting with our fellow cohort-mates and articulating our biggest fears about the program.  I spent some time this morning looking back through those, and I noticed a trend.  Not to toot our own horns, but the fact that we all got to this stage indicates that we are all intelligent, motivated, courageous individuals.  Sure, we all come from different backgrounds and have different stories, but the fact is we all made this leap and got accepted into this well-respected program.  Clearly, we have something going for us.  And yet, one theme wove through nearly all of the admissions: "What if I can't keep up?" "What if I become a burden to everyone?" "What if I get to Phase 1 and it becomes obvious that I don't belong?"  <strong>"What if I'm not good enough?</strong></p>

		<p>As we were all diving into a completely new field, these fears are to be expected.  As we continue through the DBC program, however, it'll be important for us to be aware of the <strong>imposter phenomenon</strong> creeping in.  The imposter phenomenon in which a person has an overwhelming sense of self-doubt regardless of her accomplishments.  It's the feeling of being a fraud despite evidence to the countrary. Commonly referred to as the "imposter syndrome", leading <a href"http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7245-468a">researchers in the field</a> avoid using the term syndrome due to it's negative connotations.</p>

		<p>It's easy to see how this could come into play at DBC.  During peer pairs, I've found myself regularly apologizing for not knowing an obscure method.  A common piece of feedback I've been giving is "Be more confident!  You have the skill, trust yourself to use it!"  Learning something brand new can be stressful, and we all desperately want to succeed -- at times it can feel like a never-ending, uphill battle.  Regardless of how much we know, there's always more to learn, especially since we've chosen an ever-evolving field.</p>

		<p>In researching this phenomenon, it was almost a relief to know that even the most wildly successful people experience it.  On the flip side, it was troubling (though I suppose not surprising), to discover that high-achieving women are especially plagued by it.  I've always considered myself fairly confident in my abilities, so it was disconcerting to read about behaviors that I often have.  Feeling the need to over-work to accomplish tasks, attributing success to external factors--these were part of my daily routine when I was teaching.  I didn't even reaize what I was doing to myself.</p>

		<p>As with many such phenomena, being aware of it's existence goes a long way.  I've felt the imposter phenomenon kick in at the beginning of most weeks of new curriculum, when I feel especially incapable.  Instead of letting myself be swallowed by self-doubt, I've paused to look back on my accomplishments.  I go back through my previous week's solutions, and see just how far I've come.  It's been important for me to remember how unsure of myself I was on previous topics, and then see how much I can do with them know.  We've signed up for a long journey, one that hopefully isn't going to end with DBC.  If we're going to make it through with some semblance of sanity, each and every one of us is going to have to practice shaking the feeling of being a fraud.  We've come a long way, we've worked hard for where we are, we deserve to be here.</p>
