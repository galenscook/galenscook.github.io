			<h4>My name is Galen Cook.</h4>
			<p>Chances are, if you know another Galen, it's a boy.  I've learned to live with that.  I kind of like being an anomaly.  On my homepage I claimed a lot of titles, and this is where I back it up.</p>
			<section class="left">
			<h5>Beginner Programmer</h5>
			<p>I'm enrolled in <a href="www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>.  Though I've always liked to consider myself tech-savvy, my interest in the coding side began during college.  After years of tinkering with online tutorials as a hobby, I finally decided to fully commit myself to understanding and ideally impacting this ever-changing field.  By the end of the program, I'm hoping to change this title to, as DBC says, "World Class Beginner Programmer".  I don't look at DBC as the end of my training, merely the end of the first step.</p>

			<h5>Life-Long Student</h5>
			<p>Cheesy, yes, but also accurate.  I'm curious.  If there's one thing I'm sure of it's that I don't know enough.  I want to learn all the things, try all the things, experience all the things--lofty goals that I know will never happen, but they keep me going.  Stagnation scares me, and nothing revitalizes me like a project.  Part of the reason I was so excited about DBC was because I was going to get to devote all my energy into learning something.  I love the whole process--from when you first start and everything feels awkward, to excitement over the tiniest progress (I'll never forget how thrilled I was to say a full sentence in french), to the hard work and never-ending uphill climb towards mastery.  My other current project is learning how to do a back walkover.  I'm convinced I'm not too old.  We shall see.</p>

			<h5>Puppy Enthusiast</h5>
			<p>Seriously.  Is there anything more wonderful than a puppy?  I don't discriminate, I love all shapes, sizes and breeds.  During college a group (to be honest, I have no idea who these fantastic people were) brought puppies to campus during exams as a way to lift spirits and alleviate stress.  Nobody could resist stopping.  You know why?  Because puppies are little bundles of joy and love.  Who can say no to that?  (Side note:  I don't currently have a dog, but I'm a GREAT dog auntie if you have one you'd like to share.)</p>

			<h5>Former Teacher</h5>
			<p>Part of the reason I didn't pursue tech immediately out of college was because I was accepted into <a href="www.teachforamerica.org">Teach for America</a>, where my love of children easily translated into a fierce passion for my students and their futures.  I found myself again on the rollercoaster that is middle school as I strived to be a source of stability, support and guidance for 70 seventh-graders each year.  Trying to get 12-year-olds excited about and engaged in math and science when their lives revolved around Instagram and Kik (a messenging service) was tough, but not impossible.  The biggest compliment a student ever gave me was that I was her Ms. Frizzle (you better believe I kept Magic School Bus alive).</p>

			<h5>San Francisco Transplant</h5>
			<p>Part of taking the leap into DBC was moving my life to San Francisco.  Or, in my mind, "the big city".  Yes, I know, San Francisco is tiny.  But you have to remember that I'd spent the previous three years the North Shore of Oahu, one of the Hawaiian islands.  The North Shore prides itself on being the one of the only rural parts left on the island.  The only time I wore shoes was when I went to work--businesses (and even restaurants if I've being honest) were used to bathing suits and sandy feet.  So for me, this was a big change.  But I was (and am) excited.  I love this city, and once I purchase a few more layers (do you guys realize how cold it is here?) I'm sure it'll quickly become home.</p>

			<h5>Die-Hard Tarheel</h5>
			<p>I've moved around a lot, though no, I'm not military (people always ask).  Having lived in eight states, "Where are you from?" can be a tricky question.  I always have the same answer: "North Carolina".  I spent four wonderful years on the best campus in the world -- The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Aside from being THE first public university in the nation (which generally makes it awesome), Carolina is a mecca for inspired learners, AND, let's be real, a sports powerhouse.  I was there in 2009 when we won the NCAA title, and it was unreal.  Did I mention that six of the players on the Women's World Cup Championship team were Tarheels?</p>
