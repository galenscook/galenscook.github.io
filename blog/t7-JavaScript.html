		<h1>Missing Ruby, Learning JavaScript</h1>
		<h2>Classes and constructor functions</h2>
		<h4>8|2|15</h4>
	
	<section>
		<p>After spending four weeks getting all nice and comfy in our Ruby bubble, DBC came along this week with a giant pin.  <strong>JavaScript.</strong>  The user-friendly, non-scary, endlessly forgiving Ruby vanished from our lives and left in it's place is symbol-heavy, you-can-put-that-there-but-it-doesn't-mean-I'll-do-anything-with-it, JavaScript.  I mean, I get it.  You want to interact with users on your website?  You need JavaScript.  But if I give input data of the wrong type, I just wish JS would tell me, you know, instead of randomly converting it to a type that IT thinks makes sense... </p>
		<p>
			Alright, enough griping.  Clearly, I'm learning something new and it's hard and I miss what I've gotten used to.  But JavaScript isn't going anywhere and it's HIGHLY useful, so I need to put on my big girl pants and figure it out.  Which I've started to do!  I've spent a large portion of this week mentally comparing Ruby and JavaScript, trying to use my knowledge of one to give me a leg up in the other.  In all reality, they are structurally very similar.  Both are dynamically typed, and object oriented.  One glance at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference">JavaScript Docs</a> makes it pretty clear that we don't have access to the seemingly endless built-in methods that Ruby does, but the more I use it the more I've found ways to, in essence, replicate these methods I've grown to know and love.
		</p>
		<p>
			Building off of the last two tech posts, I want to talk about Ruby classes.  A Ruby class is a robust tool that allows the programmer to set common behaviors for groups of objects, then call various instances of the class.  Let's look at our puppy class from last week.
		</p>
		<pre><code>class Puppy
  def initialize(name, gender, breed)
    @name = name
    @gender = gender
    @breed = breed
  end

  def name
    @name
  end

  def gender
    @gender
  end

  def breed
    @breed
  end
end

taco = Puppy.new("Taco", "male", "chihuahua")
taco.breed
=> "chihuahua"
</code></pre>
		<p>
			You might notice that this week I've defined three methods, one for each instance variable.  This allows us to access the objects' information.  Ruby uses classes in a BIG way to organize information and behaviors.  Not only can you build classes manually as needed for your program, but there are also many built-in classes that Ruby uses to provide utility, such as <code>Strings</code>, <code>Integers</code>, and <code>Hashes</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Classes don't exist in JavaScript, but as I indicated before, there are ways to essentially provide the same function.  Enter: <strong>Constructor Functions</strong>.  Like classes, you can use constructor functions to create new instances with predetermined properties.  Let's use our puppy information to define a constructor function.
		</p>
		<pre><code>function Puppy(name, gender, breed){
  this.name = name;
  this.gender = gender;
  this.breed = breed;
}

var taco = new Puppy("Taco", "male", "chihuahua");
console.log(taco.gender);
=> "male"
</code></pre>
		<p>
			As I'm sure you've noticed, this looks REALLY similar to the <code>initialize</code> function.  And, for all intents and purposes, it is.  There are a few differences.  One, obviously, the syntax.  I warned you--JavaScript is all about the semicolons and curly brackets.  But let's look beyond that.  In creating this constructor function, we've created what JavaScript calls a prototype.  A prototype is basically an empty object with certain predetermined properties.  When we use the <code>new</code> method, we create a new object based off this prototype, assigning values to the properties.  
		</p>
		<p>
			I will admit it, there is one aspect of prototypes that I appreciate that classes do not have--the ability to add properties.  Let's say we know all puppies bark, we can add this to the prototype.
		</p>
		<pre><code>Puppy.prototype.bark = true;
var taco = new Puppy("Taco", "male", "chihuahua");
console.log(taco.bark);
=> true
</code></pre>
		<p>
			After two weeks of working with Ruby classes I was only just beginning to feel like I understood their true potential.  Naturally, constructor functions and prototypes still feel foreign to me, but I know with JavaScript's inheritance they will end up playing a big role.  As painful as it is training my fingers to enclose everything in curly brackets, I know I'm going to be a better programmer for getting a firm grasp on JavaScript while continuing to brush up on my Ruby knowledge.
