		<h1>Learning to Learn from Others</h1>
		<h2>Peer pairing and feedback</h2>
		<h4>7|16|15</h4>
	
	<section>
		<p>In the tech "real world" (I think of DBC like I thought of college--definitely not the real world.), many companies have adopted partner coding as standard practice.  It makes sense, when you think about it.  Two brains = better than one.  Especially for projects where one missed colon can make the entire program eat itself.  Partner coding both allows you to build off each other resulting in tremendous products and also provides a second set of eyeballs for those "Hey, I'm pretty sure you meant to type <code>nums</code> not <code>nomz</code>," moments.  As we all know, one day we are going to have to leave our DBC bubble and re-enter said real world, and the wonderful brains behind DBC try to make this as easy as possible by introducing partner coding right from the get-go.  We call it <strong>peer pairing</strong>.</p>
	
	<h5>Stage 1 -- Working together</h5>
	<p>
		I was super nervous for my first peer pair.  In my PR studies in college we did a lot of group projects, and they never really ended well.  One or two of us did all the work, and the end result was never cohesive--I always felt like I could have produced a better final paper, presentation, etc. on my own.  That's what I was expecting with peer pairing.  Not, mind you, that I thought I was going to be the one shouldering all of the work (not quite as confident in my coding skills, yet), but that one of us would, and the other would basically just watch.  As afraid as I was for that to happen, I was even more afraid of being the one who was just watching, so I found myself over-preparing for my first few peer pairs.  I'd go in with basically a working solution in mind, and try to subtly steer us towards it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I quickly found that these pairs don't work like group projects in college.  Even when I came into the session with a solution in mind, in working with my partner we never ended there, because we'd come up with an even more elegant way of tackling the problem.  It really is phenomenal what two brains can do, as long as they are both willing and ready to truly work together.  It's important to know that pairing doesn't reduce workload or time--in fact, it often takes longer when working with a pair.  In pulling apart the problem together, though, I've found I've left pairing session with stronger solutions and a stronger grasp on the material.  It's good when you and your pair can challenge each other, really push to ensure that you're coming up with the best possible code, and that you know why each piece works.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now, my fear of the unbalanced pair is sometimes a reality.  Having been on both sides of it, I've come to realize that it's not always a bad thing.  When I've been the one who is behind, my partners have been great about explaining steps in a way that makes concepts that I'd read about a million times just all the sudden click.  Plus, feeling like I'm the lagging partner kind of lights a fire under me, making me put even more effort into catching and brushing up.  On the flip side, when I've been the stronger of the two, I've felt the teacher come out in me.  I've guided by asking questions, and (as didn't surprise me, after time in the classroom) I've found myself getting a firmer grasp on concepts by finding new ways to explain.
	</p>
	<h5>Stage 2 -- Reflecting for improvement</h5>
	<p>
		Successfully working with people is a skill that must be honed over time.  You can learn a lot based on your feelings during/after a pair, as well as your final product, but that only gives you a one-sided perspective.  In order to actually become a better pair, you need to consider feedback from other parties.  This is very common in all kinds of workplaces.  While feedback from a supervisor or superior of some sort is the most common, peer feedback can at times be even more helpful, because they are the ones with whom you are interacting with on a regular basis.  I was fortunate enough to have co-taught half of my classes while I was a teacher, and we integrated feedback into our daily routine.  Yes, it was uncomfortable at first.  It's really hard to hear critiques of your work, and even harder, at time, to hear critiques of what it's like to work with you.  But, ur sit-downs at the end of each school day to talk about the highs/lows/everything in between were the single most influential part of my growth as a teacher.
	</p>

	<p>
		My co-teacher and I called this our "reflection time", but in essence we were using it as a way to give each other feedback and learn from each other's insights.  As a way, I believe, to ease us into this, DBC uses an anonymous feedback system.  We are all new to this and to each other, so by keeping feedback anonymous it encourages us to be more honest and forthcoming.  I have a strong personality, and I know that (especially in remote pairing) I have the tendency to take control.  I knew this going in and tried to be very cognizant of taking the time to, well, shut up and listen.  It was reassuring hearing from my first few pieces of feedback that my pairs felt that I was sharing responsibility and listening well.  Whenever you're working on something, it's always good to hear that it shows.
	</p>
	<p>
		The hardest part of writing feedback for me is giving constructive critism, and from what I can tell it's the area most of us are struggling with.  Growth stems from constructive criticism, so I know how important and beneficial it is, I just always have a tough time figuring out what specifically I can suggest for my pairs.  I know it sounds harsh, but I'm not super worried about hurting my pair's feelings -- as a teacher it was my job to find areas for improvement.  So this is something else I've been working on.  When we're done, I pause for a second and think "What would have made this session more efficient/effective."  Thus far, I've generally been coming up with things both of us could have done.  But I've decided that's okay.  If the only people who were flawless gave feedback, we'd all be in trouble.  Just to ease my own mind, I've been including a little "This is something I need to work on too" note in my feedback, but I've found in realizing these joint areas for improvement it helps me with my own reflection.  Double win.
	</p>
	<p>
		To be perfectly honest, peer pairing was the portion of DBC I was least looking forward to.  I'm thinking now it was a little bullheaded of me.  But, hey, if I've learned anything from my 10+ pairs, it's that nobody's perfect, and if you are willing to take the time to figure it out, there's something to learn from everyone.
