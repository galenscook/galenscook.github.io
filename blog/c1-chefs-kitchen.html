    <p>
      I'm coming into Dev Bootcamp after three years teaching math and science to seventh graders.  If I had to label my teaching style, I'd probably call it "controlled chaos", though it's probably a pretty liberal use of the word "controlled".  I willingly admitted to my kids that I didn't know everything, that we were in this together, that we were going to try things, some of which might not work, and that's okay.  More than anything I wanted to instill in my children a sense of curiosity and grit.  I wanted them not only to wonder about things, but have the confidence and ability to explore these wonderings and develop their own opinions, find their own solutions.  Now, as I'm sure you can imagine, this was a tall order for twelve year olds, thus the chaos.
      </p>

      <p>
      I found, however, that I appreciated the chaos.  Because, as Shereef alluded to in his <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">fireside chat</a>, many are of the mindset that education is passive.  Teachers pass information to students, students regurgitate it, thereby showing that they've "learned".  No wonder students are bored in school.  I hated it, I wanted my students to be active learners.  My favorite thing was when they asked me a question I didn't know the answer to.  It gave me the opportunity to model that not knowing isn't a dead end, rather it's a chance to figure something out, to learn.
      </p>

      <p>
      I believe that it was this mindset that drew me to DBC.  Right from the start I appreciated the emphasis the program puts on "soft-skills", because it aligns with the values I had in my classroom.  The idea of a restaurant mindset (where you order an experience off a menu) versus a kitchen mindset (where you take an active role in creating the experience for yourself and those around you) is a fantastic analogy that I wish I could have used in my classroom.</p>

      <p>
      Now, that doesn't mean that I'm not nervous.  Because I am, I'm super nervous.  When it came down to it, in my classroom I was still the one who had the answers and the guidance.  It's terrifying to start something new.  But at the same time, it's exhilarating.  Hearing Shereef talk about how the program is still an experiment makes me even more excited, because that means I have the opportunity to be a part of the progress.
      </p>

      <p>
      Overall, Shereef's video got me fired up about my next 18 or so weeks.  I'm excited to meet my cohort and see what, together, we can all accomplish.  To my fellow cohort -- I apologize in advance for mistakes I make along the way, and hope I'll be able to help you through a couple of yours as well!
      </p>
