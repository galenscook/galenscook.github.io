          <h1>Site Revamp</h1>
          <h2>FINALLY</h2>
          <h4>8|13|15</h4>

          <p>
            Since the very day I launched this site, part of me has been cringing.  I <em>know</em> that the point was for it to document our learning as we progressed, but I also knew that it was destined to be transported directly from the 1990's.  We were just going over basic HTML/CSS stuff with manual positioning, and the point was to get our feet wet.  And so I practiced and tinkered and cursed positioning and tinkered some more, but I knew that my site looked dreadful.
          </p>
          <img src="../imgs/oldhomepage.png" alt="My first design's homepage" class="img-responsive">
          <p>
            Now, I'm not a web designer by any means.  I don't have an eye for aesthetics, and haven't ever been known as the "creative type".  But I had done some work with <a href="www.getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, so I knew there was an easier way.  I kept "planning on" working my site into a Bootstrap framework, but as the weeks went on it kept feeling like a bigger and bigger endeavor to undertake.  <em>(Lazy, I know.)</em>  <strong>Luckily</strong>, during this final week of Phase 0 (onsite starts on Monday, y'all!), DBC included a major website revamp in our curriculum.  The time had come.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were a few major things I wanted to accomplish with this redesign:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>REDO ENTIRE HOME PAGE</strong> &rarr; Seriously, I hated it.  I wanted something fresh and sleek.</li>
              <li><strong>RESPONSIVE LAYOUT</strong> &rarr; This was a given with Bootstrap, but required a lot of tweaking my existing content to make it work.</li>
              <li><strong>MAKE CONTENT MORE READABLE</strong> &rarr; Anywhere I had chunks of text were really hard to read.  I knew I either wanted to switch up fonts or create a matting of sorts to help viewability.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            So, with those things in mind I got to work.  In a fortunate turn of events, my boyfriend was gone all this week, which allowed me to turn into a web gremlin for a couple of days.  I scoured blogs and guides, yelled at my computer, did a TON of trial and error, and ate a lot of beef jerky, and finally ended up with something I'm way happier with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I say "happier", because I'm well aware that it's still not perfect.  I still think some of the pages are too busy/juvenile (I'm toying around with the idea of a monochromatic color scheme?) and I really want to incorporate some JavaScript/jQuery, but for now, I'm pleased.  If there's one thing I've learned from diving into tech it's that everything is a work in progress.  If I waited until I felt something was "finished" before showing it to anyone, I'd be really hurting for products.  So, until next time, don't hesitate to <a href="../contact.html">get in touch</a> with any feedback!
          </p>
          <h4>Happy coding!</h4>
