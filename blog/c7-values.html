		<h1>Let Your Values Lead You</h1>
		<h2>Be honest with yourself</h2>
		<h4>8|2|15</h4>
	
	<section>
		<p>
			As we move closer and closer to the beginning of Phase 1 (15 days, y'all!), DBC is encouraging us to do more and more reflection and introspection.  As taxing as Phase 0 has been, Phase 1 is going to be a whole different animal, and I can only imagine that mental and emotional preparedness can have a great impact on not just success but overall well-being during the program.  Some people don't "buy in" to the importance of emotional intelligence and hygiene, but I do. I was fortunate enough to take an amazing series of classes with an amazing professor who placed a lot of value on understanding and building one's own EQ, so I was indoctrinated early.
		</p>
		<p>
			This week's culture exercise involved identifying values that were present during moments when we felt the happiest, proudest and most satisfied.  Identifying these values in positive situations allows us to see what tools we have at our disposal, and prompted contemplation for how we can use these values to get us through times of struggle.  There were several that I identified: self-reliance, ambition, meaningful work, friendships, adventure and enthusiasm to name a few.  But when it came down to thinking about what I use to keep myself sane and healthy when things get hard, I zeroed in on <strong>openness</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I refer to openness, I do so in several interpretations.  Being open to new experiences/opinions, being open in your communication with others, and being open to the thoughts and emotions that you are <strong>actually</strong> experiencing.  This last part is often the hardest, or at least it is for me.  You can also think of it as self-honesty.  For a long time, I was always driven by what I thought I "should" do.  I "should" get a business degree, I "should" do that summer internship, I "shouldn't" care that my friend cancelled our plans, I "shouldn't" be nervous about an upcoming solo challenge.  It was next to impossible to live up to the standards I set for myself, and then I'd get frustrated and disappointed when I didn't actually feel/think the way I thought I "should".
		</p>
		<p>
			My friend's father gave me a piece of advice during college that took a while to soak in.  "Don't should on yourself".  If you spend your time and energy thinking about what you should do, then you never address the thoughts and feelings you actually have.  I've make a concious effort to recognize my true feelings, the good, the bad and the ugly.  Acknowledging that these sometimes unfortunate feelings exist is vital, because only then can you identify the true cause and spend time figuring out how to make things better.  
		</p>
		<p>
			So, yes, I was SUPER nervous about this week's solo coding challenge.  I didn't want to be, and I spent a couple days pretending I wasn't.  Then I realized that denying it wasn't helping me AT ALL, and it was instead making the problem worse.  So I paused, and let myself admit that I was nervous.  I gave myself a bit of time to panic, and then moved through it.  I recognized that I was so nervous for this one in particular because I wasn't super comfortable with the new programming language, and I really wanted to do well.  From here, I decided to spend some time on the <a href="www.codecademy">Codecademy</a> JavaScript track to brush up on my skills and build some confidence.  Yes, that meant cutting into time that I could have been "working" on the solo challenge, but it was worth it.  After soaring through 50% of the course, I felt like I actually had a handle on this new language.  The solo challenge, while definitely challenging, became something manageable.
		</p>
		<p>
			I know not all obstacles can be tackled so cleanly.  But being able to honestly assess your thoughts and feelings is still a crucial aspect of navigating through them.  Allow yourself to experience all the feels, give yourself some time to really just soak in them, and then turn your attention to getting through.  Maybe you need to take a walk, or ask for help, or do some yoga.  Each situation is different and will call for different actions, but only by being open with yourself will you truly feel like you are in control throughout them.
