		<h1>Modules as "Mixins"</h1>
		<h2>Another tool to keep your code DRY</h2>
		<h4>7|25|15</h4>
	
	<section>
		<p>One of the simplest principles of object-oriented design (OOD) is DRY -- Don't Repeat Yourself.  If you find yourself writing the same block of code multiple times, there's almost certainly a more efficient way of structuring your program.  Lucky for us, Ruby is jam packed with various tools to help streamlining code.  In <a href="t5-ruby-classes.html">last week's technical post</a>, I went over classes, one Ruby object that allows you to assign various behaviors to multiple objects.  Today we're going to look at another tool, <strong>modules</strong>.  To start, let's take a look at the class we ended up with last week:</p>
		<pre><code>class Puppy
		   def initialize(name, gender, antic)
      @name = name
      @gender = gender
      @antic = antic
   end

   def praise
      p "Good #{@gender}, #{@name}!  What a good #{@gender}, you #{@antic}!"
   end

   def scold
      p "Bad #{@gender}, #{@name}!  You shouldn't have #{@antic}!"
   end
   end</code></pre>
		<p>
		(For the sake of this example, I've taken out the @breed variable.)
		</p>
		<p>Now, the benefit of creating this class is that we can create a new instance of it for any puppy we choose.  If we say <code>Taco = Puppy.new("Taco", "boy", "peed on the rug")</code> we would then have the ability to call our <code>scold</code> method on him.  Awesome.  Now, let's take a step back.  Imagine that we are creating a program that will, in essence, be a parent in a household.  Within this household, there are puppies, kittens, and children, all of which the parent will be interacting with.  At this point, we can see the need to create two more classes, one for kittens and one for children.  Let's do that:
		</p>
		<section class="float left">
					<pre><code>class Kitten
  def initialize(name, gender, antic)
      @name = name
      @gender = gender
      @antic = antic
   end
 end</code></pre>
		</section>
				<section class="float right">
					<pre><code>class Child
  def initialize(name, gender, antic, age)
      @name = name
      @gender = gender
      @antic = antic
      @age = age
   end
 end</code></pre>
		</section>
		<p class="clear">
		The methods that each of these classes will contain will vary.  You wouldn't, for example, need a method in your <code>Child</code> class to see when the next dose of heartworm medicine is due.  Some methods, however, will overlap.  Couldn't you, for instance, praise your kitten for properly using the litterbox just like you'd praise a puppy for peeing outside?  And, to take it a step further, wouldn't this praise be suprisingly similar to what you'd say to a child you're potty training?  Coding the same praise method into these three classes would not be DRY programming.  This is a prime opportunity to use a <strong>module</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>Modules are VERY similar to classes.  They, too, are bundles of methods and objects, and help organize programs into small, reusable components.  Unlike classes, however, you don't create instances of modules.  Instead, you apply the functionality of the module onto various classes or objects.  There are a variety of ways to utilize modules, but for now we're just going to look using modules to "mix" behaviors into classes.  Whenever you find yourself repeating behaviors in multiple places, it's a prime time to use a module.
		</p>
		<p>Back to our example -- the behavior we are seeing being repeated is the ability to be praised or scolded.  Rather than define the same methods for each class, we can instead write a new module:
		</p>
				<pre><code>module Praisable_scoldable
   def praise
      p "Good #{@gender}, #{@name}!  What a good #{@gender}, you #{@antic}!"
   end

   def scold
      p "Bad #{@gender}, #{@name}!  You shouldn't have #{@antic}!"
   end
 end</code></pre>
 		<p>We have now created this module that we can use in ANY class where we could feasibly praise an instance.  In order to mix the module in, we use an <code>include</code> statement.  Our puppy class can now be refactored to look like this:</p>
 				<pre><code>class Puppy
  include Praisable_scoldable
  def initialize(name, gender, antic)
      @name = name
      @gender = gender
      @antic = antic
   end
 end</code></pre>
 		<p>If we inserted the same <code>include</code> statement into all of the three classes, we would now have access to both the praise and the scold methods.  Calling them would go as follows:</p>
 		<pre><code>matthew = Child.new("Matthew", "boy", "got an A on the math test")
taco = Puppy.new("Taco", "boy", "peed on the rug")
luna = Kitten.new("Luna", "girl", "caught the mouse")

matthew.praise => "Good boy, Matthew!  What a good boy, you got an A on the math test!"
taco.scold => "Bad boy, Taco!  You shouldn't have peed on the rug!"
luna.praise => "Good girl, Luna!  What a good girl, you caught the mouse!"
 		</code></pre>
 		<p>
 				By using the <code>include</code> statement, we have access to methods written within the module, even though they aren't defined in the class itself.  In this way, modules can significantly simplify our code and keep it DRY.  This is only one of the ways to use modules to promote good OOD, but it's a very useful one.  Think about it, how many classes of "things" could you include the <code>Praiseable_scoldable</code> module on?  Pets, students, significant others -- the list goes on and on!
 		</p>
 		<h4>Happy coding!</h4>
