  <h1>The Melting Pot that is My Brain</h1>
  <h2>Capitalizing on my thinking style</h2>

    <p>
      As part of our prep work for Phase 0 in DBC (yes, prep work for the prep phase), we did some research and introspection on our individual thinking and learning styles.  (Side note:  I was a psychology major in college, and always have a hard time with these tests because I read too much into the questions and try to figure out what each answer could indicate.  I tried my very best to go with my gut response and <em>not</em> do that on these tests.)  My results, however, were not super helpful:
      <blockquote>
        34 - Concrete Sequential<br>
        32 - Abstract Sequential <br>
        20 - Abstract Random <br>
        34 - Concrete Random <br>
      </blockquote>
      <h5>A three way tie!</h5>Great.  

      <p>
        So, as a concrete sequential thinker I tend to be based in reality, but as an abstract sequential thinker I love the world of theory and abstract thought.  The concrete random thinker in me is an experimenter.  Basically, the one big takeaway I can get from the Gregorc Thinking Style Quiz is that, since my abstract random score was the lowest of the four, I won't do well in an unstructured, people-oriented environment.

        Rather than get frustrated with my wishy-washy results, I've decided to look at it optimistically.  According to the test, I'm not pigeonholed.  I can learn and thrive in a number of different environments.  Looking at my working and learning history, I think it's more that I NEED different environments.  I have the tendency to get distracted and bored, and by constantly looking at new problems in new ways, I keep myself stimulated and focused.

      <p>
        I've enjoyed all of the work I've done so far with DBC, and feel pretty confident about what I've learned.  I think I can credit a lot of this to my split thinking styles.  There's been little to no stagnation, no ruts to fall into because I'm constantly being pushed to do more, learn more and tackle new problems.  I've been engaging all parts of my brain--the list-maker, the trial-and-error-queen, the note-taker, the researcher, the problem-solver--and none of them alone can take over if I want to succeed.  It's kept me engaged and, even more impressive for someone like me, very focused.
      </p>

        In writing this blog post, I'm realizing how excited I am about this journey I'm embarking upon.  It's the first time I've really allowed myself to dive 100% into something and really enjoy the process, not just the destination.  I still haven't quite figured out where programming is going to take me, but I'm loving how much I'm stretching my mind along the way.  Here's to maintaining my stride!
